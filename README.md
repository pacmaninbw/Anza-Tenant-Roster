# Anza-Tenant-Roster

I'm trying to help the apartment complex I live in by automating some of the tasks the management office performs on a daily basis.

The tenant roster is a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. I initially started and completed this project using VBA for excel, however, the excel application they are using is a starter edition and does not support VBA. I therefore created an app using C# and the Microsoft Interop libraries for Excel and Word. The user interface is using Window Forms.
